# Staging Interaction

**Collaborators:** Rachel Minkowitz (rhm256), Shai Aarons (sla88), Jon Caceres (jc3569), Ariana Bhigroog (ab2959), Amando Xu (ax45)

## Part A. Plan 

Setting: The kitchen and any other room a person decides to go into from the kitchen - possibly a bedroom or home office. This device is used while things are cooking or baking in an oven.

Players: The user, the oven, the food, potentially other people in the room

Activity: Rachel puts her cake in the oven, she starts a timer for 30 minutes and then walks away into another room to do homework. She can monitor the progress of the baking cake by just looking at the display on her mini desktop oven sitting next to her in her room. When the oven timer starts the display is red, when the timer is halfway through the display is yellow and when the cake is officially ready, the display turns green and Rachel knows to head back to the kitchen. The cake is cooked perfectly!

Goals: Rachel's goal is to make a perfectly cooked cake - not too raw but not overdone, the goal of the mini oven is to keep track of timing to know when to food is finished cooking/baking without Rachel having to physically move to the oven.

**Feedback**

- What about making some sort of reminder to go back to the oven if the food needs basting or rotation?
- What happens if you're not paying attention to the screen??
- This would be good for people who are hard of hearing - in case they dont hear timers, it requires very little attention to remember to go back to the oven


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

- No one really has a wallclock and since we're using our phones for Tinkerbelle, watching the time interferes with the color
- Some of us don't set timers on our ovens and rather rely on external timers like a phone timer, aka Siri.
- Since the colors only represent an approximation, there is no precise indication of how much time is remaining.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

- Instead of using different colors for different amounts of time remaining, what about using a gradient that can change from a completely solid red window to a completely solid green window where the colors are transitioning from red to green in between - acting more like an ombre progress bar.
- Possibly creating a wearable device that can be worn around the house rather than sitting on a desk.


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Feedback on Tinkerbelle**

- Overall, using Tinkerbelle was pretty smooth. When setting up on the Mac device, some of us needed to include --user in order for the requirements.txt to properly install with Python3. Also, we opted to use local machines rather than virtual ones.


## Part D. Wizard the device

**Follow Up Work**

- Red means not done
- Yellow means halfway done
- Green means ready to be eaten

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

In our first rendition of the device we thought to create a 'mini desktop oven' that people can look at if they're waiting on something in the oven while working at their desk. This device would be about the size of a tissue box (easily left on a desk) and it's 'window' would be the changing light display. This device is optimal for those that spend lots of time at their desks and want a trendy, functional addition to their desktop setting. Since the setting of a desktop could be both a light and dim setting (when the room light is shut off) the display would react to the external lightsource and brighten/dim accordingly.

While we were sketching out the mini desktop oven the idea that someone might not be tied to their desks came up. So we decided to go with a wearable device as well. Creating a wearable mini oven would allow the user to walk around and travel while they wait on their food. We opted for an inconspicuous looking wristwatch which has oven components and who's face changes colors according to food readiness. This item would allow for a certain amount of flexibility when using and can prove functional to active people who often multitask.

The third design we went with is by far the most inconspicuous. We were thinking about people who live in small spaces, don't have a desk, or don't have room on their desk for a mini desktop oven. Our third design is a colored light that is integrated into a lamp. As with the other designs - the color of the light changes according to how ready the food is but this time the lamp is not a standalone device and turns into a lamp as long as their is nothing in the oven. This device lends to a clean asthetic, does not create clutter and looks like a regualar lamp when not in use.

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

The group as a whole did a great job collaborating on work and providing feedback in order to iterate through the design process smoothly. Thank you to our great film creators - Jon, Ariana, and Shai! Thank you Rachel for drawing the prototypes and Amando for making sure everything is in place.

Thank you OpenAI for creating Dall-E which we used to create the storyboard (+Jon's Photoshop skills)


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

It would be cool if the color on the phone would reflect the color of the bread instead, since bread goes from white to brown to dark brown.

Very useful idea. Whenever I make frozen pizza, I forget about it and it always burns - having this not only improves the aesthetics of the desk, but it reduces the possibility of screwing up simple baking tasks. The cinematography was very creative as well. I liked the take of the POV of the oven. Shoutout to Shai for acting skills.

## Part A. Plan 

_Background_: 
The TeeTurtle Reversible Octopus Plush Toy (TROPT) is a simple, yet genius innovation in the realm of emotional communication amongst Gen-Z and other TikTok-identifying generations. The basic premise of the TROPT is to display your emotions to your partner, roommate or parents without actually talking about your emotions. If you are feeling happy, simply have the TROPT display its smiley face, otherwise display its sad face (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxC9SVnBvKU). While it may seem completely unhealthy to converse emotions through a plush toy, we believe that this serves humans who struggle communicating emotions in the modern digital age. Hence, we base the inspiration of our design on the TROPT.

<img width="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/73a4ded9-26eb-4a6b-b78e-70c67b9ef36a">



_Setting:_ Residential households where more than one person (or a person and a pet) are living. The interaction will typically occur between separate rooms or separate parts of the same room. The device can be placed on any counter-top, but is most helpful on bedside tables, desks or living room coffee tables. The interaction occurs when the mood/emotions of one of the players shifts.

_Players:_ The players of this interaction are typically people (of all ages) or pets who are living in the same house/apartment together. This device serves as a two-way communication channel between only two parties. A primary example of typical users would be couples living in an apartment together. Another example of typical users would be a dog and its owner living in the same space together. Other users could be parents with their infant children or roommates living in the same home. 

_Activity:_ The major activity here is when the mood/emotion of one of the players shifts to a different mood. The mood-changing player will perform an action (as listed in the below sections), that will trigger a change in the other players device- color and sound, indicating an emotional shift has occurred. This is meant to be a simple means of demonstrating/communicating feelings. The owner of the device displaying emotional change can then take action depending on the emotion displayed.

_Goals:_ The goal of the first user is to display emotions to the other player. The goal of the second user is to understand how the emotion-displaying user is feeling, and take action depending on the mood displayed. An example of this is when a person in a couple is feeling sad, the second person in the couple can hug the sad person.

- Some storyboards were made using Dall-E.

**Feedback**

- "It would be cool if the Apple watch could check Blood Alchohol Levels" - it would be indeed 
- "The dog communication idea is really cool for me to know if my dog is hungry etc. but how would your device understand emotion?" - indeed we do not know
- "I dont love to unload my entire day to my S.O. when I get home - it would be cool to have a device that I can keep track of her emotions throughout the whole day instead of only in one sitting after the fact" 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

- Those of us with pets can relate to the issue of our pet experiencing lots of changes in emotions that can’t always be fulfilled by the owner. The dog mood indicator is a great way to gauge the general feelings of our pet but may be excessive (or annoying) if you have a pet that’s always hungry or always wants to play (and constantly alerts the owner of such).
- Since children aren’t the best communicators (at this stage) the child mood tracker is a great way to know how your child is feelings, however, it may be unrealistic to expect a child to consistently have a wearable device on them since children are prone to losing and/or damaging things.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

- Perhaps implementing a more sophisticated digitalization of alerts would be helpful for some of our ideas. Instead of receiving alerts on a device, maybe a notification via a custom app would be more helpful for some of our ideas.
- Instead of a sudden change of color for our couple mood prototype, maybe a slow ombre transition into a different color for a different mood, can help couples understand when their partner is about to feel or experience a specific mood and perhaps attend to their partner needs before they fully experience it. Kind of like knowing what your partner is feeling before they fully experience it. I imagine this can help mitigate a lot of situations in  a relationship.

\*\***Influences of the design**\*\*<br>
We've designed a device that has an input and output mechanism - the input would be a light wearable like a watch or collar, or a remote control style stick and the output would be the device that someone else keeps in order to keep track of the wearer's or holder's mood. Our main concern is the look and feel of the output device. 

The output device would generally be stationary in order for the tracker to be able to view the person's or pet's mood while in a house etc. With that said, in our first two renditions of the device we thought to create a 'mini doll' version of the person or pet that's mood is being tracked. This plush toy has a screen where the mouth should be and the mouth color and shape change according to the person who's wearing the compatible device's mood. The figurine also has embedded speakers that output a noise or soung according to the mood. This device would be about the size of a small plush toy (easily left on a hard surface) and it's 'mouth' would be the changing light display. This device is optimal for those that spend lots of time at home (maybe they WFH) and like to know what's going on with their kids or pets while not with them. Since the setting of a desktop could be both a light and dim setting (when the room light is shut off) the display would react to the external lightsource and brighten/dim accordingly.

The other rendition of this device is a more inclusive design. This design is about the size and feel of a tissue-box and includes generic eyes and mouth window. This device also has a speaker embedded in it. It's purpose would be for someone who wants a more impersonal experience when tracking their loved ones, or wants a more versatile asthethic for a cleaner look. This design allows someone to leave their mood output device in their kitchen as it's easily cleanable and can even blend in with other appliances.

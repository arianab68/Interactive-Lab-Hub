# Staging Interaction

**Collaborators:** Rachel Minkowitz, Shai Aarons, Jon Caceres, Ariana Bhigroog, Amando Xu

## Part A. Plan 

Setting: The kitchen and any other room a person decides to go into from the kitchen - possibly a bedroom or home office. This device is used while things are cooking or baking in an oven.

Players: The user, the oven, the food, potentially other people in the room

Activity: Rachel puts her cake in the oven, she starts a timer for 30 minutes and then walks away into another room to do homework. She can monitor the progress of the baking cake by just looking at the display on her mini desktop oven sitting next to her in her room. When the oven timer starts the display is red, when the timer is halfway through the display is yellow and when the cake is officially ready, the display turns green and Rachel knows to head back to the kitchen. The cake is cooked perfectly!

Goals: Rachel's goal is to make a perfectly cooked cake - not too raw but not overdone, the goal of the mini oven is to keep track of timing to know when to food is finished cooking/baking without Rachel having to physically move to the oven.

**Feedback**

- What about making some sort of reminder to go back to the oven if the food needs basting or rotation?
- What happens if you're not paying attention to the screen??
- This would be good for people who are hard of hearing - in case they dont hear timers, it requires very little attention to remember to go back to the oven


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

- No one really has a wallclock and since we're using our phones for Tinkerbelle, watching the time interferes with the color
- Some of us don't set timers on our ovens and rather rely on external timers like a phone timer, aka Siri.
- Since the colors only represent an approximation, there is no precise indication of how much time is remaining.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

- Instead of using different colors for different amounts of time remaining, what about using a gradient that can change from a completely solid red window to a completely solid green window where the colors are transitioning from red to green in between - acting more like an ombre progress bar.
- Possibly creating a wearable device that can be worn around the house rather than sitting on a desk.


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Feedback on Tinkerbelle**

- Overall, using Tinkerbelle was pretty smooth. When setting up on the Mac device, some of us needed to include --user in order for the requirements.txt to properly install with Python3. Also, we opted to use local machines rather than virtual ones.


## Part D. Wizard the device

**First Attempts:**

**Follow Up Work**

- Red means not done
- Yellow means halfway done
- Green means ready to be eaten


## Part E. Costume the device

**Device Sketches**

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

In our first rendition of the device we thought to create a 'mini desktop oven' that people can look at if they're waiting on something in the oven while working at their desk. This device would be about the size of a tissue box (easily left on a desk) and it's 'window' would be the changing light display. This device is optimal for those that spend lots of time at their desks and want a trendy, functional addition to their desktop setting. Since the setting of a desktop could be both a light and dim setting (when the room light is shut off) the display would react to the external lightsource and brighten/dim accordingly.

While we were sketching out the mini desktop oven the idea that someone might not be tied to their desks came up. So we decided to go with a wearable device as well. Creating a wearable mini oven would allow the user to walk around and travel while they wait on their food. We opted for an inconspicuous looking wristwatch which has oven components and who's face changes colors according to food readiness. This item would allow for a certain amount of flexibility when using and can prove functional to active people who often multitask.

The third design we went with is by far the most inconspicuous. We were thinking about people who live in small spaces, don't have a desk, or don't have room on their desk for a mini desktop oven. Our third design is a colored light that is integrated into a lamp. As with the other designs - the color of the light changes according to how ready the food is but this time the lamp is not a standalone device and turns into a lamp as long as their is nothing in the oven. This device lends to a clean asthetic, does not create clutter and looks like a regualar lamp when not in use.

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

The group as a whole did a great job collaborating on work and providing feedback in order to iterate through the design process smoothly. Thank you to our great film creators - Jon, Adriana, and Shai! Thank you Rachel for drawing the prototypes and Amando for making sure everything is in place.

Thank you OpenAI for creating Dall-E which we used to create the storyboard (+Jon's Photoshop skills)


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

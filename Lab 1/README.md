# Staging Interaction

**Collaborators:** Rachel Minkowitz, Shai Aarons, Jon Caceres, Ariana Bhigroog, Amando Xu

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

## Part A. Plan 

Setting: The kitchen and bedroom. This device is used when things are cooking or baking in a oven.

Players: The user, the oven, the food, potentially other people in the room

Activity: Rachel puts her cake in the oven, she starts a timer for 30 minutes and then walks away into another room to do homework. She can monitor the progress of the baking cake by just looking at the display on her mini desktop oven sitting next to her in her room. When the cake is officially ready, the display turns green and Rachel knows to head back to the kitchen. The cake is cooked perfectly!

Goals: The goal of the mini oven is to know when food is finished cooking/baking in the oven without having to physically move their ass to the oven

**Feedback**


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

- No one really has a wallclock and since we're using our phones for tinkerbell, watching the time interferes with the color
- Some of us don't set timers on our ovens and rather rely on external timers like a phone timer, aka Siri.
- Since the colors only represent an approximation, there is no precise indication of how much time is remaining.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

- Instead of using different colors for different amounts of time remaining, what about using a gradient which can change from a completely solid red window to a completely solid green window where the colors are transitioning from red to green in between - acting more like an ombre progress bar.
- Possibly creating a wearable device that can be worn around the house rather than sitting on a desk.


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

**Feedback on Tinkerbelle**

- Overall, using Tinkerbelle was pretty smooth. When setting up on the Mac device, some of us needed to include --user in order for the requirements.txt to properly install with Python3. Also, we opted to use local machines rather than virtual ones.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**First Attempts:**

Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Follow Up Work**

- Red means not done
- Yellow means halfway done
- Green means ready to be eaten


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

- We use Dall-E plus Jon Caceres's immense Photoshop skills to create the storyboard


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
